                    <h3>How Curiosity Shaped My Future</h3>

                    <div class="essay-box">
                        <p>
                            I have always enjoyed the quiet moment when you stare at a computer screen and wait for
                            something to happen. It feels like a chance to build something from nothing. Growing up in
                            Karachi teaches you early that if you want structure, you often have to make it yourself.
                            While my friends were busy playing games or scrolling through their phones, I was the one
                            trying to figure out what was going on inside the machine. I wanted to see how the so called
                            black box actually worked.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            It began with small questions. How can a line of code tell a machine what to do. Where does
                            a message go after I press send. Now, as an A Level student studying Physics, Mathematics
                            and Computer Science, I spend most of my time solving problems like these. But the more I
                            learned about how the internet is put together, the more I noticed how weak it can be. I
                            realized that building software means little if you cannot protect it. That thought pushed
                            me away from only writing code and toward the world of cybersecurity.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We are living in a time where everything moves quickly. Artificial Intelligence is
                            impressive, but it also exposes our data in ways we are not ready for. Our personal details
                            and financial records live in the cloud, and they are easier to steal than most people
                            understand. AI is giving hackers new tools and speed. One data breach today can bring down a
                            company or damage a person’s life. Watching all of this made my path clear. I do not want to
                            just work in this field. I want to lead it.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            My long term goal is to start my own cybersecurity firm that helps people stay safe. I
                            imagine a company that offers different levels of protection so clients can choose what fits
                            their needs. A small startup would not need the same coverage as a large government agency.
                            Higher levels would offer stronger encryption and deeper monitoring. My aim is to make cyber
                            attacks so costly and difficult that hackers will not see any value in trying.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Apart from screentime, I spend my time playing cricket or working with my robotics team.
                            Playing as a batsman for my school and college team forced me to slow down and think before
                            reacting. It feels similar to predicting a cyber threat. Working with my robotics team was
                            different. I often had to keep everyone focused and deal with hardware problems while time
                            was running out. Whether I am running between wickets or repairing a sensor on a drone, I
                            rely on the same habit of studying the situation and finding the best answer.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I am ready for the next step in my education. I want the knowledge and training that will
                            help me turn these plans into real solutions and build stronger defenses for the digital
                            world.
